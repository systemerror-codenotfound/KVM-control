This is for controling a KVM over UART

I guess there are a lot more KVM's that use this type of control

It use a small remote with 4 buttons and it comunicate with the KVM over a custom USB Cable.

The most important part is that the signal is inverted, so you have to invert the UART Logic on the config.

I had to also modify the uart_read_line_sensor.h to change the way it thinks the data was received.
You have to place the file on the esphome folder
