This is for controling a KVM over UART

I guess there are a lot more KVM's that use this type of control

It use a small remote with 4 buttons and it comunicate with the KVM over a custom USB Cable.

I actually followed this info to start

The most important part is that the signal is inverted, so you have to invert the UART Logic on the config.

I had to also modify the uart_read_line_sensor.h to change the way it thinks the data was received.
You have to place the file on the esphome folder

I placed a bypass button on D7 on the D1 mini as i had to ensure that i would be able to switch even if the wifi fails.

The button it's only switching between PC1 and PC2 but you can add more adding more if entries.

The components needed are:
1 USB Female
1 protoboard
1 ESP8266 D1 Mini
1 button
1x 10k resistor

The connection would be:
5V from USB Female to 5V input on D1 mini
Ground to Ground
D+ to D2
D- to D1

Ground to button
Button to D7
And you will have to place the 10k resistor between D7 and 5V in order to use it as pull-up

Once all sordered and configured you will have 6 entities on Home Assistant
4 Entities that you can push to change to PC1,PC2,PC3 and PC4 and also the bypass entity that monitor the button
You also have a text entity that monitor the current PC in use.

The debug is enabled but you can disable it after wiring and testing.
